I have contributed several automations to my organization, which have helped reduce the number of licenses required and ultimately resulted in cost savings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we used GITHUB as remote repository
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code in the "branch_creation" folder creates a Git branch by taking the source GitHub branch and then pushes the newly created branch to GitHub
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code in the "Recreate_branch" folder discards the target branch for backup purposes and creates a new branch, which is then pushed to the remote repository.
Code in the "dumps" folder create an Zip file for a specific commit.
The code in the "commit_log" folder will list the 'n' number of commits based on action and depth you provide, On the other hand it will check whether a secific commit exist in branch or not.
The code in the "commits_all_folders" will display latest commit of every folder in the branch.

We have model Jenkinfiles in "Jenkins_files" folder for all the above automations.
