I have contributed several automations to my organization, which have helped reduce the number of licenses required for DEVOPS team and ultimately resulted in cost savings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- we used GITHUB as remote repository. <br>

- The code in the **'branch_creation'** folder creates a Git branch by taking the source GitHub branch and then pushes the newly created branch to GitHub. <br>

- Code in the **'Recreate_branch'** folder discards the target branch for backup purposes and creates a new branch, which is then pushed to the remote repository.<br>

- Code in the **'dumps'** folder create an Zip file for a specific commit.<br>

- The code in the **'commit_log'** folder will list the 'n' number of commits based on action and depth you provide, On the other hand it will check whether a secific commit exist in branch or not.<br>

- The code in the **'commits_all_folders'** will display latest commit of every folder in the branch.<br>

- We have model Jenkinfiles in **'Jenkins_files'** folder for all the above automations.<br>
